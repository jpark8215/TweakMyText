# TweakMyText

## Inspiration

The inspiration for **TweakMyText** came from a personal frustration I experienced while working across different professional contexts. I noticed how challenging it was to maintain a consistent, authentic voice when writing emails to colleagues, creating content for different audiences, or adapting academic writing for various purposes.

Existing AI writing tools felt generic and impersonal — they could make text formal or casual, but they couldn't capture the unique quirks, patterns, and personality that make someone's writing distinctly theirs. I realized there was a gap in the market for a tool that could learn from your actual writing samples and transform any text to match your authentic voice.

The "aha moment" came when I thought: **What if AI could write like YOU specifically?** Not just following general style guidelines, but actually understanding and replicating your personal writing patterns, tone preferences, and communication style. This led to the core concept of a writing style matcher that learns from user-provided samples.

## What It Does

**TweakMyText** is a sophisticated AI-powered writing style rewriter that transforms any text to match your unique writing voice.

### Core Functionality

- **Style Learning**: Analyzes 2–3 writing samples from users to detect tone, formality, enthusiasm, technical complexity, and other style patterns.
- **Text Transformation**: Takes any input text and rewrites it to match the user's detected writing style.
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Uses advanced algorithms to identify writing patterns like vocabulary choices, sentence structure, and emotional tone.

### Subscription-Based Features

#### Free Tier:
- Basic style analysis
- 3 writing samples
- 1M tokens/month
- 100K daily limit
- 5 exports/month

#### Pro Tier:
- Advanced analysis
- 25 writing samples
- 5M tokens/month
- 6 tone controls
- Rewrite history
- 200 exports/month

#### Premium Tier:
- Extended analysis
- 100 writing samples
- 10M tokens/month
- All 10 tone controls
- Unlimited exports
- Full analytics

### Advanced Features

- **Tone Controls**: Adjust formality, casualness, enthusiasm, technicality, creativity, empathy, confidence, humor, urgency, and clarity.
- **Rewrite History**: Track and analyze writing transformations over time.
- **Export System**: Download results in multiple formats with tier-based limits.
- **Security & Analytics**: Comprehensive audit logging and usage analytics.

## How We Built It

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, Vite for development
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
- **AI Integration**: Built with Claude API integration-ready (currently using a sophisticated mock system)
- **Security**: Comprehensive audit logging and subscription validation

### Architecture Decisions

- **Modular Component Design**: Each component has a single responsibility for maintainability
- **Security-First Approach**: Validation and audit logging at every level
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features unlock based on subscription tier
- **Token-Based System**: Flexible usage tracking that scales with user needs

### Database Schema

- Core tables: `users`, `writing_samples`, `rewrite_history`, `security_audit_log`, `billing_history`

### Key Technical Features

- **Subscription Validation**: Server-side enforcement with client-side progressive disclosure
- **Export Service**: Centralized export handling across multiple components
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper cleanup and mounted refs
- **Performance Optimization**: Pagination, memoization, and efficient re-rendering

## Challenges We Ran Into

1. **Subscription Complexity**: Managed feature access across tiers with progressive disclosure and a validation system.
2. **Token System Migration**: Migrated to a token-based system while preserving all user data.
3. **Export Tracking Consistency**: Centralized ExportService ensured uniform tracking.
4. **Password Change Flow Issues**: Implemented proper `AbortController` usage and completion flags.
5. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Resolved component updates after unmount using mounted refs.
6. **Performance with Large Datasets**: Implemented pagination, infinite scroll, and memoization for rewrite history.
7. **AI Integration Without Dependencies**: Developed a mock system simulating realistic transformations.
